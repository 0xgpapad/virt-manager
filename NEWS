 Virtual Machine Manager News
 ============================

Release 0.2.6
-------------

The release focus has been on major bug fixing. This is also the
first release in which (partial) translations are available for
the UI in approximately 20 languages - thanks to the Fedora i18n
team for excellant progress on this. It is now possible to control 
the virt-manager UI with command line arguments as well as the DBus
API & it DBus activation is no longer used by default which fixes
interaction with GNOME keyring & AT-SPI accesibility. Numerous
UI issues were fixed / clarified, particularly in the graphical 
console and new VM creation wizard.
