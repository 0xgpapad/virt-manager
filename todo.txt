  TODO before first release
  =========================

check all XXX/TODO in the code, make sure nothing important is missing
revive import blacklist for virtinst code, maybe just a unittest that checks Gtk isn't in globals ?
break out osdistro bits so we don't need to carry virt-install.pod

is tui working? maybe just remove it, check with mcpierce
gsettings port (or fix gconf bindings)
website: wiki-ify the whole thing, drop static content, move site styling into virt-manager.git, kill the old web repo. and get that old hideous screenshot off the front page. linux-kvm.org should be the template here.
consider dropping python-distutils-extra dep. I think we rely on about 300
    lines of code, tops, and since it isn't in RHEL it could be an issue.
    we can prob reimplement the bits that are important to us fairly easilly.
python3? consider it

removing hardware can give:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/crobinso/src/virt-manager/src/virtManager/details.py", line 1254, in hw_changed
    if self.compare_hw_rows(newrow, oldrow):

start a spice guest, shrink the window to smaller than guest resolution, scrollbars work but don't have any actual 'bar'.





  Manager spacing bug
  ===================

spacing is weird in manager, prefs window. cant have unequal tree rows
- have 3 rows: qemu, test default, test custom
-- connect to test:///default, watch the parent rows expand
- doing col.set_sizing(Gtk.TreeViewColumnSizing.AUTOSIZE) for the stats
    column helps but doesn't fix it entirely, the bottom row will still
    expand weirdly.
- save this till the end, narrow it down to a simple reproducer and try and
    fix, probably a gtk3 issue.
- list size issues: master actually has bigger list size than collapsed gtk3 rows, maybe that is part of the issue.



  Object leaks
  ============

objects leak on cleanup, pygobject has reference counting issues
- https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692044

- leak detection disabled in the manager.py for now
