  TODO before first release
  =========================

consider dropping python-distutils-extra dep. I think we rely on about 300
    lines of code, tops, and since it isn't in RHEL it could be an issue.
    we can prob reimplement the bits that are important to us fairly easilly.

start a spice guest, shrink the window to smaller than guest resolution, scrollbars work but don't have any actual 'bar'.

website: audit new site content. simplify download page to not have explicit lists to previous releases, just link to NEWS and release directory. update my release script.


  Manager spacing bug
  ===================

spacing is weird in manager, prefs window. cant have unequal tree rows
- have 3 rows: qemu, test default, test custom
-- connect to test:///default, watch the parent rows expand
- doing col.set_sizing(Gtk.TreeViewColumnSizing.AUTOSIZE) for the stats
    column helps but doesn't fix it entirely, the bottom row will still
    expand weirdly.
- save this till the end, narrow it down to a simple reproducer and try and
    fix, probably a gtk3 issue.
- list size issues: master actually has bigger list size than collapsed gtk3 rows, maybe that is part of the issue.
- check if manual themeing at the top of manager.py is still required/works
