  TODO before first release
  =========================

virtinst merge bits:
    make sure translations actually work when installed
    break out osdistro bits so we don't need to carry virt-install.pod
    merge README, reference that we merged virtinst and see that repo for
        old NEWS, etc.

is dbus uniqueness still working? I dropped the service file but it
    shouldn't be necc.
check all XXX/TODO in the code, make sure nothing important is missing
is tui working? maybe just remove it, check with mcpierce
gsettings port (or fix gconf bindings)
gtkapplication + drop dbus uniqueness stuff? at least investigate it
python3? consider it
website: wiki-ify the whole thing, drop static content, move site styling into virt-manager.git, kill the old web repo. and get that old hideous screenshot off the front page. linux-kvm.org should be the template here.
consider dropping python-distutils-extra dep. I think we rely on about 300
    lines of code, tops, and since it isn't in RHEL it could be an issue.
    we can prob reimplement the bits that are important to us fairly easilly.
move RHEL/fedora spec file bits to upstream file like libvirt does
revive import blacklist for virtinst code, maybe just a unittest that checks Gtk isn't in globals ?


  Misc issues
  ===========

test:///default->test->Details: Switch to processor page and 'apply' is activated, shouldn't happen. I think it affects master branch as well

removing hardware can give:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/crobinso/src/virt-manager/src/virtManager/details.py", line 1254, in hw_changed
    if self.compare_hw_rows(newrow, oldrow):

    if row1[idx] != row2[idx]:

    return info.invoke(*args, **kwargs)
TypeError: argument allocation: Expected cairo.RectangleInt, but got tuple


virt-manager: drop all the HAL code, we could convert to udev but it's not
    really worth it given interface + nodedev APIs


start a spice guest, shrink the window to smaller than guest resolution, scrollbars work but don't have any actual 'bar'.



  After virtinst merge
  ====================

drop old stuff from both spec files
update README
virtinst initrd test: drop the big files? just stub em out
setup.py rpm: drop hardcoding rpm version, specify it with rpmbuild
setup.py rpm: dump output in sourcedir, or dist/

INSTALL docs about python setup.py refresh_translations from virtinst,
    or whatever the distutils extra equiv is. or update po/README,
    or have a TRANSLATORS file, or update HACKING, etc. see what other
    projects do. msgmerge with python setup.py build_i18n --merge-po

  Manager spacing bug
  ===================

spacing is weird in manager, prefs window. cant have unequal tree rows
- have 3 rows: qemu, test default, test custom
-- connect to test:///default, watch the parent rows expand
- doing col.set_sizing(Gtk.TreeViewColumnSizing.AUTOSIZE) for the stats
    column helps but doesn't fix it entirely, the bottom row will still
    expand weirdly.
- save this till the end, narrow it down to a simple reproducer and try and
    fix, probably a gtk3 issue.
- list size issues: master actually has bigger list size than collapsed gtk3 rows, maybe that is part of the issue.


  Object leaks
  ============

objects leak on cleanup, pygobject has reference counting issues
- https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692044
- https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=693111
- leak detection disabled in the manager.py for now
- see if gtk.grab_get_current autodrawer leak fixed by gtk3
