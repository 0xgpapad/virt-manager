  Notes on translation process
  ============================

The translations for virt-manager are handled by the fedora community
via transifex. Translations are committed directly to the repo, so the
maintainers job is quite easy :)

To update the virt-manager translation template, run

  make update-po

Translators can easily sign up to contribute:
