    Virt Manager TODO list
    ----------------------

A list of random items which need implementing in no particular
order / importance:


 1. Handle renaming of domains. Libvirt caches the name when you get
    the initial handle to the domain, so this may be more difficult
    than it seems - particularly since we really want to minimse as
    may XenD RPC/HTTP calls as possible

 2. Implement tracking of network & disk stats. Needs support in 
    libvirt.

 3. Support for dealing with inactive / passive domains

 4. Auto-resize console window to match size of virtual displays

 5. Deal with VNC display resizing

 6. Ability to send arbitrary keystrokes to VNC (ie keys which local
    WM would otherwise capture, eg Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch console)

 7. Implement 'open terminal' to get serial console

 8. Pick up VNC port from domain's XML
